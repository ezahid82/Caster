### reflection 

I leanred that on-shape is a very easy to use, and fast way to make objects and assemble them. I learned some shortcuts that helped me alot like

* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

### Reflection


making the mount was relly easy. watching someone do it and then you see them and go along, makes it really easy to do the mount.

### Reflection

This was a really challenging assignment. It took lots of diminsioning (**D**), fillet(**shift-f**), extrude (**shift-e**). But I was able to do it smoothly, even though  I made some mistakes along the way.

### Reflection

At first I thought that this was going to be hard. But it wasn't, first I made a 2D shape that was made from a rectangle. the rectangle was revolved around the horizantle construction line to give it the circular shape.

### Reflection
this part wasn't really hard to make. the challenging part was when you had to use the (use) part (shortcut**u**) to choose two of the sides of the collar.then use a circle (**c**), qonstruction (**q**) to make the whole in the collar.
