### reflection 

I leanred that on-shape is a very easy to use, and fast way to make objects and assemble them. I learned some shortcuts that helped me alot like

* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

## Mount


### Description

the second assignment is to make a Mount for the caster. the mount's dimensions are 120 mm x 120 mm x 8 mm thick. it has four wholes 10 mm wide, and are equally spaced from the corners. there is one larger whole in the center 25 mm wide.

### Reflection


making the mount was relly easy. watching someone do it and then you see them and go along, makes it really easy to do the mount.

### Fork


### Description

the third assignment is about making a fork for the caster. it has two circles at teh top of the two forks. It is 10 mm wide the fork is 56 mm high. the circular ring of the fork is 78 mm in the diameter.

### Reflection

This was a really challenging assignment. It took lots of diminsioning (**D**), fillet(**shift-f**), extrude (**shift-e**). But I was able to do it smoothly, even though  I made some mistakes along the way.

## Tire


### Description

the forth assignment is about making the tire of the caster. it has a dark color. it is 80 mm in diameters, and has a 20 mm center distance.

### Reflection

At first I thought that this was going to be hard. But it wasn't, first I made a 2D shape that was made from a rectangle. the rectangle was revolved around the horizantle construction line to give it the circular shape.

## Wheel

### Description

the fifth assignment is to make a wheel to hold the tire. it has a diametere of 80 mm. it is made up of 4 circles, 80 mm, 70 mm, 25 mm, 10 mm.

### Reflection

the wheel was the hardest one so far. it took a really long time to finish, and there was lots of diminsioning (**D**), fillet (**shift-f**), and extruding (**E**)

## Axle,Collar


### Description

The 6th and 7th assignment is the axle and collar. it is a long tube with two flat tops that are used to hold the bottom of the screws. The flat part is 10 mm long each, the diameter of the tube is 10 mm. the diameter collar is 15 mm.

### Image

### Reflection
this part wasn't really hard to make. the challenging part was when you had to use the (use) part (shortcut**u**) to choose two of the sides of the collar.then use a circle (**c**), qonstruction (**q**) to make the whole in the collar.

## Sub Assembly


### discription 

this is the sub assembly of the caster. it has the wheel,tire,axle,bearings. the tire was mated to the wheel by the fastened mate (**m**) the axle is located at the center of the wheel, while the bearing is located in the axle.

### Reflection
this was my first time assembling something in onshape. it seemed difficult at first looks, but onshape has made it really easy to mate and assemble things together. I used the fastened mate(**m**) to mate the wheel and the tire together. Then I used the revolved mate (**m**) to put the bearing around the axle.

## Final Assembly


### discription

the is the final assembly for the caster. it has bolts,nuts, and pins in the holes. This was a combination of the sub-assembly which made it easier to put all of the together. I inserted the collars, the sub-assemly, the base, and the mount to make the final product. I used revolve mate(**m**) alot to make them be able to rotate.

### Reflection
This final assignment was a bit challenging. useing revolve mates, parallel mates, and fastened mates to put all of it together. I had to revelove(short-cut**m**) most of the parts to make them be able to rotate. I ran into some problems with the mount and the base that required me to go back and change the dimentions of the holes. The fun part was at teh end were I had to put screws in the holes of the base and the mount. the chalenging part was the sub-assembly where I also had the wronge dimentions for the fork and so I wasn't able to put the bearing in.

# Dowel-pins



## dowel-pins


### Discripsion

the dowel pins are small pins that would be put in wood frames to hold them together. The dowel pins were configured so that I can use many sizes at any time.
the pins have 16 different sizes and diameters. teh lengths are (1/2 in,  1 in, 1+1/2 in, 2 in.)

### reflection

I had lots of problems with the videos for making the dowel pins. I wasn't able to make the last part and finish the dowel pins, but I was able to make the pins. It seemed hard at first. But after trying it, it was really easy. I made 16 different sizes of pins with different diameters and lenghts.
